<h2>What is Qucs-S?</h2>

Qucs-S is a spin-off of the <A href=http://qucs.github.io/>Qucs</A>
cross-platform circuit simulator. "S" letter indicates SPICE. The purpose of 
the Qucs-S subproject is to use free SPICE circuit simulation kernels with 
the Qucs GUI. It merges the power of SPICE and the simplicity of the Qucs GUI. 

Qucs intentionally uses its own SPICE incompatible simulation kernel Qucsator.
It has advanced RF and AC domain simulation features, but the most of existing 
industrial SPICE models are incompatible with it. 

Qucs-S is not a simulator by itself, but it requires to use a simulation backend
with it. The schematic document format of Qucs and Qucs-S are fully compatible. 
Qucs-S allows to use the following simulation kernels with it:

<ul>
	<li><A href=http://ngspice.org>Ngspice</A> is recommended to use.
	Ngspice is powerful mixed-level/mixed-signal circuit simulator. The
	most of industrial SPICE models are compatible with Ngspice. It has an
	excellent performance for time-domain simulation of switching circuits
	and powerful postprocessor.</li>
	<li><A href=https://xyce.sandia.gov>XYCE</A> is a new SPICE-compatible
	circuit simulator written by Sandia from the scratch. It supports basic
	SPICE simulation types and has an advances RF simulation features such
	as Harmonic balance simulation. </li>
	<li><A href=http://spiceopus.si>SpiceOpus</A> is developed by the Faculty of
	Electrical Engineering of the Ljubljana University. It based on the
	SPICE-3f5 code</li>
	<li>Qucsator as backward compatible</li>
</ul>

	<li>Direct support of SPICE models from components datasheets. SPICE
	model could be added to schematic without any adaptation.</li>
	<li>Basic SPICE components: RCL, BJT, MOSFET, JFET, MESFET, switches;</li>
	<li>Advanced SPICE components: Equation-defined sources and RCLs, transmission lines;</li>
	<li>Direct support of SPICE Modelcards, SPICE sections (.IC, .NODESET);</li>
	<li>Parametric circuits (.PARAM) and SPICE postrprocessor (Nutmeg)</li>
	<li>Basic SPICE simulations: DC, AC, TRAN;</li>
	<li>Advanced SPICE simulation: DISTO, NOISE, Spectrum analysis;</li>
	<li>Single-tone and Multitone Harmonic balanace analysis with XYCE
	backend;</li>
	<li>Nutmeg script simulation: direct access to the SPICE code and
	construct your own simulation;</li>
	<li>XYCE script simulation type;</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="inst">Installation</h2>

<h3>Linux</h3>

<h4>Binary package</h4>

You can use prebuilt binary DEB-package for Debian-8. Ubuntu-16.04 is also
tested. Download and install it with <tt>dpkg</tt>:

<tt>
dpkg -i qucs-s-0.0.19S-RC8_x86_64.deb
</tt>

You may need to install the following dependencies:
<tt>lib4qt4-qt3support</tt>,<tt>libqt4-svg</tt>, <tt>ngspice</tt>

<h4>Building from source</h4>

If your Linux distribution is not Debian-based, then you will need to build
Qucs-S from source:

<ul>
	<li>Install all necessary dependencies: Qt, C++ compilers, etc.</li>
	<li>Install desired simulation backends: Ngspice, XYCE, SpiceOpus. You can use all
        these backends together or only one of them. Install basic Qucs (0.0.18 or
        newer) if Qucsator is needed. </li>
	<li>Download and unpack tarball</li>
	<li>Use CMake to compile. Autotools doesn't support this installation mode and
        will not work!</li>
	<li>Invoke <tt>make</tt> and <tt>make install</tt></li>
</ul>

The complete command sequence to build Qucs-S is following:

<p>
<tt>
tar xvfz qucs-0.0.19S-RC7.tar.gz<br>
cd qucs-0.0.19S-RC7<br>
mkdir builddir<br>
cd builddir<br>
cmake ..<br>
make<br>
make install<br>
</tt>

<p>
The last command <tt>make install</tt> should be executed from <tt>root</tt> user. It will
install Qucs-S into default prefix <tt>/usr/local/</tt>. No additional configure
options are needed now. 

<h3>Windows</h3>

You need to use binary installer for Windows. You need to download and install
Ngspice and/or XYCE manually from official websites: <A	href=http://ngspice.org/>http://ngspice.org/</A>
<A href=https://xyce.sandia.gov/>https://xyce.sandia.gov</A> respectively.

It's recommended special build of Ngspice-26 for Windows
<A href=https://github.com/ra3xdh/qucs/releases/download/0.0.19S-rc6/Ngspice26_QucsS.zip>Ngspice26_QucsS.zip</A>
. Default Ngspice package also will work but it may have some limitation. Custom
Ngspice build solves the following issues:

<ul>
	<li>Windows GUI of Ngspice is disabled. It allows Qucs-S to obtain logs from
	Ngspice.</li>
	<li>Added CMPP preprocessor and C headers set mandatory for development of
	CodeModel libraries. Default Ngspice build is shipped without it.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<h3>Linux</h3>

Run <tt>qucs-s</tt> from the command line or launch Qucs-S icon in your desktop
environment menu after installation. You will need to select default simulation
backend at the first run. You can change it later in application settings.

<h3>Windows</h3>

Launch Qucs-S in the system <i>Start</i> menu. You will also need to select default
simulator on the first application start. You will need to set default simulator
at the first run. Correct simulator paths setting is necessary for Windows.
